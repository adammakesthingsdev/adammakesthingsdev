Hey, I'm Adam!

I'm a high school student and engineering hobbyist. I dabble in electrical, mechanical, and computer science, with a particular passion for systems engineering and automation.

Some things I've been up to lately:
- Developing a polar 3D printer from scratch (it runs Klipper!)
- Designing a microcontroller for mass production for Hack Club's Sprig console
- Creating a fully-automated modular shipping and logistics software as part of Hack Club's Mail Team

If you want to reach out, shoot me a message @adammakesthings on the Hack Club Slack or adam@adammakesthings.dev :)
